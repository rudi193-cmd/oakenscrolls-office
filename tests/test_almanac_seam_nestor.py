"""almanac_seam, backed by Nestor's verified-match engine.

Two things the old exact-token-AND matcher could never do:
  1. a misspelled / reworded claim still finds its source (fuzzy fallback);
  2. a graded citation can be SEALED as a Nestor pair with provenance, so
     'this prediction was resolved against this public source' becomes an
     auditable, verified match — the same engine that resolves entity aliases
     and reconciles figures, now grading predictions against public records.

Offline: fake almanac clones under a temp ALMANAC_DATA_ROOT; Nestor over its
reference in-repo SqliteStore. No network, no almanac-data checkout required.
